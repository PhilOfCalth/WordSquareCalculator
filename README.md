## Overall Methodology
1. The problem was broken down into user stories (available under [userstories.md](userstories.md))
2. Each story has acceptance criteria ordered in terms of dependence
3. One at a time each of the acceptance criteria was converted into at least one unit test
4. Once created the test initially fails as it has no implementation. Thus it is made to pass before moving on (`TDD: Red/Green/Refactor cycle`)
